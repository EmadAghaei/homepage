                                        There are several barriers that can make onboarding to open source software
                                        development challenging:

                                                Lack of knowledge or experience: If you are new to software development
                                                or open
                                                source, it can be intimidating to get started. You may not know where to
                                                find
                                                resources or how to contribute effectively.

                                                Complex codebases: Some open source projects have large, complex
                                                codebases
                                                that
                                                can be overwhelming for newcomers to navigate.

                                            <li>
                                                Lack of clear documentation: If a project lacks clear documentation, it
                                                can
                                                be
                                                difficult for newcomers to understand how it works and how they can
                                                contribute.

                                                communities or may not be welcoming to newcomers. This can make it
                                                difficult
                                                to
                                                get help or guidance when needed.

                                                Difficult contribution process: Some open source projects may have a

                                                or
                                                rigid contribution process, which can be intimidating or confusing for
                                                newcomers.
                                            </li>

                                                Lack of time: Open source development can be time-consuming, and it may
                                                be
                                                difficult for newcomers to find the time to get involved.

                                    There are a few ways to remove or reduce onboarding challenges in open source
                                    software development:

                                            documentation available for newcomers to refer to. This can include guides
                                            on how to
                                            get started, how to contribute, and how the codebase is structured.

                                        <li>
                                            Encourage a welcoming and supportive community: Create a welcoming and

                                            community culture that is open to helping newcomers get started and get
                                            involved.
                                            This can include providing resources and guidance, as well as being patient
                                            and
                                            helpful when answering questions.

                                    <h3> Microtask Programming as a solution</h3>
                                    We believe adapting <strong> microtask programming</strong> can address several
                                    challenges exists in open source software develpment. Microtask programming refers
                                    to the practice of breaking down larger programming tasks into smaller, more
                                    manageable pieces that can be completed independently. This approach can have a
                                    number of impacts on programming, both positive and negative:</br></br>
                                    Positive impacts:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            Microtask programming can make it easier for developers to focus on one
                                            small task at a time, which can help reduce cognitive load and improve
                                            productivity.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It can also make it easier for developers to collaborate on larger projects,
                                            as each developer can work on their own microtask without having to
                                            coordinate with others.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Microtask programming can also be useful for distributed teams, as it allows
                                            developers to work on their own tasks independently and at their own pace.

                                            Microtask programming can sometimes lead to a lack of overall context, as
                                            developers
                                            may not have a full understanding of the larger project or how their
                                            microtask fits
                                            into the overall picture.

                                            It can also lead to a lack of ownership or responsibility, as each developer
                                            is only
                                            working on a small part of the project and may not feel as invested in the
                                            overall
                                            outcome.

                                            Microtask programming may also require more overhead and coordination, as
                                            each
                                            microtask must be clearly defined and tracked separately.

                                    To investigate the potential benefits and drawbacks of microtask programming we
                                    conducted a controlled experiment. We focused our investigation on the context in
                                    which microtasking is most widely used, implementing
                                    and debugging function bodies, and investigated the impact of microtasking with
                                    respect to onboarding, project velocity, code quality, and developer productivity.
                                    28 developers worked to implement microservice endpoints, either in the form of
                                    traditional programming tasks described in an issue tracker or as programming
                                    microtasks. Our study did not examine the design effort necessary to prepare for
                                    microtask programming or consider how microtask programming might be applied
                                    to maintenance tasks. We found that, compared to traditional programming, microtask
                                    programming reduced onboarding time by a factor of 3.7, increased project
                                    velocity by a factor of 5.76 by increasing team size by a factor of 7, and decreased
                                    individual developer productivity by a factor of 1.3. The quality of code did not
                                    significantly differ. Through qualitative analysis of how developers worked, we
                                    explore potential explanations of these differences. These findings offer evidence
                                    for
                                    the potential benefits that adopting microtask programming might bring, particularly
                                    in cases where increasing project velocity is paramount.

# Prosonal webpage

Homepage Template is a repository that provides a pure boilerplate template to make it easier to create a new 
simple personal webpage (check the Creating a repository from a template article).

The main goal of this template is to speed up the setup phase of personal webpage development for both new and experienced developers.


## Getting started

By creating a new project using the current template, you start with no history and no reference to this repository. This allows you to create a new repository easily without having to copy and paste previous content, clone repositories, or clear the history manually.

All you have to do is click the [Use this template] button.

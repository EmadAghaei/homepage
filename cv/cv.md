## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

- **Researcher at Human-centric Software Engineering lab**, GMU, Fairfax, VA, USA Aug
2017 - Present\
I work at the intersection of software engineering and human-computer interaction. I study the interac-
tion between developers and programming development tools. My research goal is to make developers
more productive by providing better development tools and approaches. To achieve this goal, my
research involves understanding developer behaviors, identifying problems, and designing tools and ap-
proaches to help with those problems using various human-centered methods at each stage.

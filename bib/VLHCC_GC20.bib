  abstract={Crowdsourced software engineering offers many opportunities for reducing time-to-market, producing alternative solutions, employing experts, learning through work, and democratizing participation in software engineering. There are several types of crowdsourced software engineering. One of the oldest and most common is open source software development. Another approach is competition-based crowdsourcing, where platforms such as TopCoder have increasingly become very popular with over 1,500,000 users.},
